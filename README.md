#### Hi! my name is Johan.
- I'm currently studying at a university, Development and System Analisis.
- I trying to learn lots of things, but i'd say programming, data, visuais, ui and games are on my sight.
- Looking for a cool project to make (and develop a portfolio)
- I love playing games! (sandbox, puzzle, fighting, open world, survival...). They were my starting point on learning more about Computer Science.
